What did I do this week?
I chose a topic,registered myself in LabTool,made a GitHub repository and began the primitive design for the game

How has the program progressed?
I have written the code for the game,which in itself was easy,but right now the computer picks a random choice,there is no "learning of sort" for the system.

What did I learn this week/today?
I learnt about GitHub,I knew about commits etc,but actually using them and pushing etc.

What remains unclear or has been challenging?
I am still unclear on whether I want to use markov chains or reinforced learning.This is a big decision,as it is the basis for my project,so I would love some advice.

What will I do next?
I will of course need to choose which way to go as mentioned above and then refine my code based on that.
