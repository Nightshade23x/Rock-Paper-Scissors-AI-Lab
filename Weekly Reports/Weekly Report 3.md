What did I do this week?
Implemented a multi-model Markov chain solution.This is an improvement from my old method which used single Markov chains.

How has the program progressed?
Pretty good,I still need to play more games for the system to really have enough data to more or less accurately predict my next move if I dont vary my playing style.

What did I learn this week/today?
I read the research paper that was recommened to me to improve my project,and was blown away as I didnt consider using many different models and pick the best performing one. So multi Markov models was something new I learnt. 
Also using Pylint,something I have never done and was impressed by how quickly it gave me a score.

What remains unclear or has been challenging?
If I should still keep the code for the single Markov chain part. I have still kept its code and its unittests,and I am not sure if I should just delete it or move them to another file,as I feel keeping them will help show progression.

What will I do next?
Maybe make a CLI or use Tkinter GUI because as of now the game is just being played in terminal. However,I am not sure if this is the scope of the project or just the code is enough and it should work.
