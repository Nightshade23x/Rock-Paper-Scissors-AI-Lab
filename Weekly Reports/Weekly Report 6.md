**What did I do this week? ** 

Updated my documents and created the user guide.

**How has the program progressed? ** 

I think it is ready. I will of course take into account the new feedback I receive but I am not expecting a great deal of changes or corrections required

**What did I learn this week/today? **

I guess what to include in a user guide

**What remains unclear or has been challenging? ** 

All is well

**What will I do next? ** 

Make the changes the second feedback brings back and continue to play games on the model to keep increasing the JSON file with new transitions to store.
