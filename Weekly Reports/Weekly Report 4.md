**What did I do this week?** 
This week was more focussed on documentation,as core game logic was established last week.I wrote additional test files to ensure everything is covered,and wrote and updated my testing and implementation document.
I also added stats to see which model performed best in the last 5 games.

**How has the program progressed?**
Pretty well,logic is sound,game is working well.Models are constantly learning and doing well.

**What did I learn this week/today? **.
I learnt to use coverage,as I had not used it before.Also learnt more about tests and how to ensure all parts of the project is covered by the tests.

**What remains unclear or has been challenging? **
I think as of now,I am fine.I am open to feedback and improvements,if any.

**What will I do next?** 
Maybe categorize players into categories? I dont know like one player repeats moves often,one player picks the most random moves etc.Once this personality is established,the AI counters it specifically however I am not sure how to 
implement that because there would be so many personalities.
