**What did I do this week?**
I made markov chains,they seem to be working,because the unittests were successful.I also made a testing file utilizing unittests to check if my functions work

**How has the program progressed?**
It is doing its job,and is storing previous moves and seems to be countering them well.

**What did I learn this week/today?**
I did research on markov chains,especially how to implement them.Additionally,i have never used unittests also,so i learnt how to use them also.

**What remains unclear or has been challenging?**
I guess i would like to know if my project is "good" enough in terms of if its "big" enough to be considered ok for the scope of this course.

**What will I do next?**
I think something to store the moves.Maybe a JSON file,because right now,the moves are stored in RAM,hence each time i close VS code,the moves are lost.
